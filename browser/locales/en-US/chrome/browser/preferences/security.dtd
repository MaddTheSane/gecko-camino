<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (tellMaybeForgery.label):
  The methods by which forged (phished) sites will be detected by phishing
  providers will vary from human review to machine-based heuristics to a
  combination of both, so it's important that this string and
  useDownloadedList.label convey the meaning "suspected" (and not something like
  "known").
