<h1>Customizing &brandFullName;</h1>

<div class="contentsBox">In this section:
 <ul>
   <li><a href="#toolbars">Toolbars</a></li>
   <li><a href="#add_ons">Add-ons (extensions and themes)</a></li>

</div>
<h2 id="toolbars">Toolbars</h2>

<p>This will tell you how to rearrange, hide, add, and remove toolbars in
  &brandShortName;. For those who are unfamiliar with the terminology, a toolbar
  is the (usually gray) box above the area that the web site is displayed.</p>

<ul>
  <li class="noMac"><strong>Menu Bar</strong>: This is the toolbar that contains
    the browser menus (File, Edit, Help, etc.).</li>
  <li><strong>Navigation Bar</strong>: This is the toolbar that contains the
    Location Bar and the buttons used to navigate web sites.</li>
  <li><strong>Bookmarks Toolbar</strong>: This is the toolbar that contains
    your Bookmarks Toolbar Folder bookmarks.</li>

</ul>

<p>There are two basic methods of customizing the toolbars in
  &brandShortName;:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#rearranging_toolbar_items">Rearranging Toolbar Items</a></li>
  <li><a href="#adding_removing_toolbars">Hiding, Adding, and Removing
    Toolbars</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="rearranging_toolbar_items">Rearranging Toolbar Items</h3>

<p>To rearrange the items (icons, buttons, text boxes, etc.) on your toolbar,
  <span class="noMac">right-click</span><span class="mac">press &ctrlKey; and
  click</span> on any part of the toolbar that is not a text box and select
  <span class="menuPath">Customize...</span>. This will bring up the toolbar
  customization dialog.</p>

<p>Drag and drop any items you want to and from the toolbars <span class=
  "noMac">(excluding the menu items)</span>. You can also rearrange icons
  already on the toolbars by dragging and dropping them wherever you wish. When
  the toolbars and items are arranged the way you want them, click
  <em>Done</em>.</p>

<h4 id="special_toolbar_items">Special Toolbar Items</h4>

<p>There are a few special items that are available to you when customizing the
  toolbar. They are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Separators:</strong> These allow you to separate items on the
    toolbars with a small vertical line.</li>
  <li><strong>Spacers:</strong> These allow you to separate items on the
    toolbars with a fixed-size space, usually around 20 pixels on most
    themes.</li>
  <li><strong>Flexible spacers:</strong> Spacers allow you to separate items
    on the toolbars with a space.  These spacers automatically resize to fill
    all of the empty space on the toolbar.  These are good for positioning
    items on the right of a toolbar.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="adding_removing_toolbars">Hiding, Adding, and Removing Toolbars</h3>

<p>You can hide the Navigation Toolbar and the Bookmarks Toolbar if you do not
  wish to keep them on your screen. <span class="noMac">You cannot hide the Menu
  Bar because you cannot move the menu items (File, Edit, Help, etc.) to a
  different toolbar, and they must stay on the screen at all times.</span></p>

<p>To show or hide a toolbar, select <span class="menuPath">View &gt; Toolbars</span>
  and click the name of the toolbar you want to show or hide.</p>

<p>To add a custom toolbar, select <span class="menuPath">View &gt; Toolbars
  &gt; Customize</span>. Click on <em>Add New Toolbar</em> (in the bottom of the
  dialog). This will give you a dialog to enter a name. If you enter a name and
  click <em>OK</em>, your new toolbar appears. Now you can drag and drop items
  to it. To remove a custom toolbar, drag and drop all the items from it, and
  click Done. You can also hide a custom toolbar as described in the previous
  paragraph.</p>

<h2 id="add_ons">Add-ons (extensions and themes)</h2>

<p>Add-ons are small pieces of software which change or add to the appearance or
  functionality of &brandShortName;. There are two kinds of add-ons: extensions
  and themes.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Extensions</dt>
  <dd>Extensions add new functionality to &brandShortName;. They can add
    anything from a toolbar button to a completely new feature. They allow the
    application to be customized to fit the personal needs of each user while
    minimizing the size and appearance of the application itself.</dd>

  <dt>Themes</dt>
  <dd>Themes modify &brandShortName;'s appearance. They allow you to change the
    look and feel of &brandShortName; and personalize it to your tastes. A
    theme can simply change button images, or it can change every piece of
    &brandShortName; appearance.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="add_ons_installing">Getting and Installing Add-ons</h3>

<p>You can download and install many add-ons from <a
  href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/" target="_blank">&brandShortName;
  Add-ons</a>. Internet searches will find many other add-ons as well.</p>

<p>When you click on a link to install an add-on, &brandShortName; displays a
  dialog asking you for permission to install the add-on. You can choose to
  allow the download and installation or to cancel the process.</p>

<h2 id="add_ons_manager">Using the Add-ons manager</h2>
<p>Add-ons are managed in the Add-ons manager. Select <span
  class="menuPath">Tools &gt; Add-ons</span> to open it.</p>

<h3 id="add_ons_updating">Updating Add-ons</h3>

<p>By default, &brandShortName; will periodically check when a new version for
  one of your installed add-ons is available. If any are available, it will
  prompt you at the next start to install any updates. You can change this
  behavior in the <a href="prefs.xhtml#advanced_update"><em>Update</em> tab</a>
  of the <em>Advanced</em> panel of &pref.pluralCaps;.</p>

<p>You can check for updates manually by selecting the <em>Extensions</em> or
  <em>Themes</em> panel and clicking the <em>Find Updates</em> button. If
  updates are available, the Add-ons manager displays an <em>Updates</em>
  panel, where you can choose the updates you want to install. Click the
  <em>Install Updates</em> button to update those add-ons.
  You need to restart &brandShortName; for changes to take effect.</p>

<h3 id="add_ons_uninstalling">Disabling, Enabling, and Uninstalling Add-ons</h3>

<p>If you want to get rid of an extension, you can either disable it temporarily,
  so it is easily available should you want to enable it again in the future,
  or uninstall it. Themes can only be uninstalled since all themes except the
  current one are disabled automatically.</p>
  
<p>To disable or enable an extension, select the extension of your choice and
  click its <em>Disable</em> or <em>Enable</em> button. To remove an add-on from
  &brandShortName;, select the add-on you wish to remove and click its
  <em>Uninstall</em> button. You need to restart &brandShortName; for changes to
  take effect.</p>

<h3 id="add_ons_further">Further functionality</h3>

<p>Further functionality such as <em>Visit Home Page</em> and <em>About</em> is
  available by selecting the add-on of your choice, <span class="mac">pressing
  &ctrlKey; and clicking on</span><span class="noMac">right-clicking</span> the
  add-on and selecting the respective item from the context menu.</p>

<h3 id="add_ons_specific">Tasks specific to extensions or themes</h3>
<h4 id="add_ons_configuring_extensions">Configuring Extensions</h4>

<p>Extensions often provide a dialog to configure their functionality. To open
  the &pref.plural; dialog of an extension, select the Extensions panel, select
  the extension of your choice, and click its <em>&pref.pluralCaps;</em> button,
  or simply double-click the extension.</p>

<h4 id="add_ons_switching_themes">Switching Themes</h4>

<p>To switch between your installed themes, select the Themes panel, select the
  theme of your choice, and click its <em>Use Theme</em> button. You need to
  restart &brandShortName; for changes to take effect.</p>
