If you choose to check with Google about each site you visit,
Google will receive the URLs of pages you visit for evaluation.  When you
click to accept, reject, or close the warning message that Phishing
Protection gives you about a suspicious page, Google will log your action
and the URL of the page.  Google will receive standard
<a href='http://www.google.com/privacy_faq.html#serverlogs'
   onclick='window.open(this.href);return false;'>log information</a>,
including a cookie, as part of this process.  Google will not associate the
information that Phishing Protection logs with other personal information
about you. However, it is possible that a
<a href='http://www.google.com/privacy_faq.html#urls'
   onclick='window.open(this.href);return false;'>URL</a> sent to Google may
itself contain personal information.  Please see the
