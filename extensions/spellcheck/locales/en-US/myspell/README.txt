Mozilla has added some words to its English dictionary. Some of these words are
regular words that are missing from the MySpell dictionary, and some are brand
names such as "Mozilla" that are valuable to Mozilla's users. The patch for
these words is checked in alongside the dictionary. If the dictionary is
updated, this patch should be re-applied.
