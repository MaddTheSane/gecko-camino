OpenOffice.org Hunspell en_US dictionary
2007-03-20 release
--
This dictionary is based on a subset of the original
English wordlist created by Kevin Atkinson for Pspell 
and  Aspell and thus is covered by his original 
LGPL license.  The affix file is a heavily modified
version of the original english.aff file which was
released as part of Geoff Kuenning's Ispell and as 
such is covered by his BSD license.

Thanks to both authors for there wonderful work.
