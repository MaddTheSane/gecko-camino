<!-- Bidi reftest 006: rtl text with diacritics. This is hard to reftest
     because if there is a bug it will typically be exhibited in the reference
     rendering as well as in the test. The approach adopted here is to use
     "overflow-x: hidden", so that if the diacritic is shifted to the right or
     left it will disappear from the test rendering and be visible (even if in
     the wrong place) in the reference rendering.
