Snapshots of cairo and glitz for mozilla usage.

We only include the relevant parts of each release (generally, src/*.[ch]),
as we have Makefile.in's that integrate into the Mozilla build system.  For
documentation and similar, please see the official tarballs at
http://www.cairographics.org/.

VERSIONS:

  cairo (1.4.2)
  glitz 0.5.2 (cvs - 2006-01-10)

***** NOTE FOR VISUAL C++ 6.0 *****

VC6 is not supported.  Please upgrade to VC8.

==== Patches ====

All patches in the cairo tree are surrounded by "MOZILLA_CAIRO_NOT_DEFINED" (which should NOT be defined).

Some specific things:

max-font-size.patch: Clamp freetype font size to 1000 to avoid overflow issues

fbcompose-bandaid.patch: Disable "optimized" code in non-MMX case due to bugs

quartz-glyph-rounding.patch: Round glyph positions, not advances, to float
