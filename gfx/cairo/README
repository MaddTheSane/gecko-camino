Snapshots of cairo and glitz for mozilla usage.

We only include the relevant parts of each release (generally, src/*.[ch]),
as we have Makefile.in's that integrate into the Mozilla build system.  For
documentation and similar, please see the official tarballs at
http://www.cairographics.org/.

VERSIONS:

  cairo (1.6.4 - 1.6.4)
  pixman (0.10.x - pixman-0.10.0-8-g0b207ae)
  glitz 0.5.2 (cvs - 2006-01-10)

***** NOTE FOR VISUAL C++ 6.0 *****

VC6 is not supported.  Please upgrade to VC8.

buggy-repeat.patch: Unconditionally turn on buggy-repeat handling to bandaid bug 413583.

clip-clone.patch: _cairo_clip_init_deep_copy should pass 0,0 as the
