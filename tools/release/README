Bootstrap Release 
-----------------

Bootstrap is a release automation tool.
Use "release -h" for help.

Pre-flight Checklist
-----------------
There are a number of manual steps that must be performed, so a default
end-to-end run will not (yet) work.

Before any steps:

* verify shipped-locales
* edit bootstrap.cfg
* edit tinder-config.pl/mozconfig 
* version bump

After Build and Repack steps:

* rsync builds to candidates dir

After Update step:

* edit patcher config
* edit mozilla/testing/release/updates/updates.cfg

After Sign step:

* create bouncer links
* rsync builds to mirrors
* wait 12 hours for mirrors to catch up
* rsync production AUS config

Steps are in dependency order. The process may be restarted at any step as 
long as all previous steps are satisfied.

PASS/FAIL verification is run after every step.
