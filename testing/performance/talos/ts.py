"""A set of functions to run the Ts test.

   The Ts test measures startup time for Firefox.  It does this by running
   Firefox with a special page that takes an argument containing the current
   time, and when the page loads (and Firefox is fully started), it writes
   the difference between that time and the now-current time to stdout.  The
   test is run a few times for different profiles, so we can tell if our
   extension affects startup time.
