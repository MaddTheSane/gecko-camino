"""A set of functions to set up a Firefox profile with the correct
   preferences and extensions in the given directory.

   Sets up the profile by copying from a base directory, editing the
   prefs.js file to set the prefs, and creating a file to link to each
   extension.  The profile is run with Firefox to make sure it is fully
   initialized and won't cause extra startup time on the first run.
