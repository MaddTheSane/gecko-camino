-p product          required. firefox|thunderbird
-b branch           required. 1.8.0|1.8.1|1.9.0
-x executablepath   required. directory-tree containing executable named 
                    'product'
-N profilename      required. name of profile to be used
-d datafiles        optional. one or more filenames of files containing 
                    environment variable definitions to be included.

                    note that the environment variables should have the same 
                    names as in the "variable" column.

Checks if the Spider extension is installed either in the named profile
or as a global extension, by attempting up to 3 times to launch the Spider.

If Spider fails to launch, the script returns exit code 66.
